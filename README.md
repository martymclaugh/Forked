# Forked:

## Team: Mac Roche, Jason Sutter, Melanie Hahn, Marty McLaughlin

A social media web app for recipes.

Built mainly in Ruby on Rails, Forked allows to to connect with friends and view not only what recipes they are cooking, but what ingredients they have as well.

You can search for recipes based on what ingredients you have, cuisine, allergies, dish (main course, side dish), and a specific type of recipe.
